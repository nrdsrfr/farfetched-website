### Updating the GitHub Pages gem
Jekyll is an active open source project that is updated frequently. If the github-pages gem on your computer is out of date with the github-pages gem on the GitHub Pages server, your site may look different when built locally than when published on GitHub. To avoid this, regularly update the github-pages gem on your computer.

Open Terminal.
Update the github-pages gem.
If you installed Bundler, run `bundle update github-pages`.
